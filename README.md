Small group project in Self supervised learning

## Goal

The goal for this project is to build a simple Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate images based on the MNIST dataset. 
We will originially only train a self-supervised model, i.e. ignoring the labels. We might later condition the model on the labels in order to 
generate a hand-drawn version of a given digit. This would be a semi-supervised approach.
